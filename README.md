# Compressor Decompressor App

### About
Objective of this project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique. This project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression. Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing. In this project, we will ensure that our compressed files can be restored to their original form.

####  Tech Stack 
- Java



### ---------HOW TO RUN---------

Step 1) Go to the main.java file and the run it.

Step 2) Select the file you want to compress or decompress (for decompression the file format should be ".gz"). After the completion of the process a dialog box will pop up displaying the message File compressed/decompressed successfully.

Step 3) The output file will be in the same directory.
